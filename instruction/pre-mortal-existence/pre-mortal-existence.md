# Pre-mortal Existence

Understanding our lives before we were born is the foundational key to unlocking our sense of purpose on earth. In the context of the restored gospel, mortality is not the beginning of our story, but rather a crucial "second act" in a three-part journey. Before the foundations of this world were laid, we existed as individual, conscious beings—spirit children of Heavenly Parents. This pre-mortal life was a period of extensive learning, character development, and preparation. By exploring our origins, we gain a clearer perspective on our divine identity, our reasons for being here, and the ultimate potential that lies within every human soul.

## Our Divine Origins and the Family of God

The doctrine of pre-mortal existence rests on the truth that we are literally the spirit offspring of God. This relationship is not merely metaphorical; it is a matter of lineage. In that heavenly realm, we lived in the presence of our Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother. This environment was one of perfect love and divine education. Just as children on earth inherit physical traits from their parents, we inherited divine attributes and the "seeds" of godhood from our Heavenly Parents.

This period of our existence was characterized by growth. We were not created out of nothing; rather, the "intelligence" or the eternal core of our being was organized into spirit bodies. As spirits, we possessed personality, agency, and the capacity to learn. We developed talents, formed relationships, and exercised our wills. This means that your personality, your inclinations toward goodness, and your unique spiritual sensitivities are not just products of your genetics or your earthly environment—they are traits you began cultivating eons ago in your heavenly home.

## The Purpose of Premortal Learning

Our time in the pre-mortal world was a season of profound schooling. We were taught the laws of the universe, the nature of righteousness, and the plan that would allow us to become like our Father. We were not passive observers; we were active participants in our own progression. 

Consider the example of a student preparing for a difficult internship abroad. Before they leave, they study the language, learn the customs, and practice the skills they will need to succeed. Our pre-mortal life functioned similarly. We were prepared for the challenges of physical bodies, the temptations of a fallen world, and the necessity of walking by faith. Some individuals distinguished themselves through their faithfulness and diligence, being "foreordained" or set apart for specific missions and responsibilities on earth based on the character they developed before they were born.

## The Veil and the Necessity of Faith

One of the most common questions regarding pre-mortal existence is: "If I lived there, why don't I remember it?" The answer lies in the purpose of our earthly trial. Upon entering mortality, a "veil" of forgetfulness was placed over our minds. This was a deliberate and necessary part of the Plan of Salvation.

If we had a perfect memory of our heavenly home and the glory of God's presence, our agency would be effectively neutralized. We would follow God's laws out of a lack of alternative, rather than out of a genuine desire to become like Him. The veil allows us to be tested in an environment where we must choose light over darkness without the overwhelming pressure of a visible divine presence. This "forgetting" allows our true character to emerge. When we choose kindness, integrity, or faith in this life, we are proving who we really are when no one—not even God—is standing visibly over our shoulder.

## Practical Implications for Daily Living

Understanding your pre-mortal roots changes how you view yourself and others. When you encounter a "difficult" person, remembering their pre-mortal identity as a child of God can shift your reaction from frustration to compassion. You recognize that, like you, they are a divine being currently struggling with the limitations of the veil and the flesh.

Furthermore, this perspective provides a "long view" of success and failure. In the grand timeline of eternity, a bad day, a failed business venture, or even a chronic illness is a small moment in a very long journey. Because you know you have already succeeded in your "first estate" (the pre-mortal life) by choosing to follow God’s plan and come to earth, you can approach life with the confidence of a proven soul. You are not a stranger on earth trying to find a home; you are a traveler who has temporarily left home to gain the experience necessary to return with increased capacity.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge: Feeling Insignificant or Lost**
In a world of billions, it is easy to feel like an accidental byproduct of biology. This can lead to a lack of motivation or a sense of nihilism.
> — Solution:** Reflect on the doctrine of "Foreordination." While this does not mean your life is scripted (you still havagency), it suggests that God knows you 
personally and has prepared specific work for you to do. You were not sent here by chance; you were sent here by design.

**Challenge: Reconciling Pre-mortal Choice with Suffering**
Some struggle with the idea that they "chose" to come to a life filled with pain or inequality.
> — Solution:** It is important to distinguish between choosing the *plan* and choosing every specific *circumstance*. Wchose to enter a world governed by natural laws and 
the agency of others. We understood that mortality would be a "proving ground" where we would face opposition. The comfort lies in knowing that we deemed the potential growth and the joy of the resurrection worth the temporary risks of the journey.

## Summary

The doctrine of pre-mortal existence provides the essential "Why" behind our "What." We are not merely biological organisms; we are eternal beings with a rich history of growth and a divine pedigree. We lived as spirits in a heavenly home, learned at the feet of divine parents, and consciously chose to undergo the mortal experience to further our progression. Though the veil hides these memories for now, the attributes we developed then remain with us today. By viewing our lives through this eternal lens, we find the resilience to face trials, the humility to treat others as divine equals, and the hope to look forward to an eventual homecoming.
